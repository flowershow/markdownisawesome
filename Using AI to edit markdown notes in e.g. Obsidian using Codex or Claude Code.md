This is an alternative to using AI tool directly in Obsidian. For the bit more technically minded.

here's a good recent thread

https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1nsija9/codex_or_claude_code_with_obsidian/

e.g.

> I use Claude Code and I have been meaning to post something here about it once I have more feedback. But so far I have been blown away about how powerful it is. I already have had it rewrite front matter on all my notes. Itâ€™s improved cross linking and added more tags to some. I have also had it fetch information about certain topics to enrich some evergreen notes, for example if I have a client it can go get more info from LinkedIn and add it in the note.

> I am not super technically minded but I got it working in less than 45 minutes or so. Anthropic has a step by step guide for how to do it but I actually ran Claude app next to it because I had to trouble shoot some unexpected issues.

> I also found this video super helpful - especially with the use cases.
